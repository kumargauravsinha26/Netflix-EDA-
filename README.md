# Netflix-EDA-
Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc. The project that I have done is Exploratory Data Analysis. The following task is performed:
a) Data Cleaning: Handling Misiing values
b) Data Analsis: By making visualisation we made inferences on the dataset
